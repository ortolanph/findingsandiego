# Where in the Code is Carmen Sandiego?

Get back to the 90's with an exciting search for Camen Sandiego through the Java code.

This code shows some ways on how Carmen or other gang member can be found using their characteristics such as gender, eye color, hair color, their occupation and their favorite food.

## How to run the examples

The `Makefile` contains many goals, each one refers to one different approach that is discusses in the article.

| Makefile goal | Meaning |
|:-------------:| ------- |
| `alldata` | Lists all the data |
| `linear` | Linear search |
| `linear-refactored` | A refactoring |
| `functional` | The functional approach |
| `predicate` | The functional approach with predicates|
| `builder` | Using the Builder design pattern to create predicates|
| `error` | An error sample |

Just run `make «goal»` to run one of the examples.

## An interactive approach

I've been thinking to build an interactive approach to Carmem Sandiego. Maybe I'll build it using SpringBoot. Check this page regularly to get updates.
